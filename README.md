## place_garfield (double wide)
1- Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) as an extension on a browser of your choice

2- Once installed click this [link](https://github.com/alwayssupergood/place_elkia/raw/master/overlay.user.js) to get the script

3- Open [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) in your browser

4- Profit

note, I tried to fix the script and expand the area of garfield comics. I only managed to expand the tile placing area, I don't think I managed to get it placing to place orange, not yellow. so here this sits archived, because I will never use it again.
